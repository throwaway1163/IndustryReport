\section*{Introduction}
Game consoles are platforms, and are in this sense analogous to operating systems upon which applications are built. These platform providers do not generally have the resources breadth or flexibility to provide a large ecosystem of software on their own, and instead choose to open up the platform to third party software.\autocite[30]{buxmann2012software}

One of the most important characteristics of software is it's reproducibility.\autocite[3]{buxmann2012software}
Since variable costs involved in software redistribution are effectively negligable it would seem natural to conclude that software licensing is more profitable than providing software services, which do not scale as cleanly.\autocite[3]{buxmann2012software}
The software market is also highly international in nature and software products are often developed by distributed teams.\autocite[3]{buxmann2012software}
