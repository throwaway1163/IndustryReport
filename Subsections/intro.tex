\section*{Introduction}

One of the most important characteristics of software is it's reproducibility.\autocite[3]{buxmann2012software}
Since variable costs involved in software redistribution are effectively negligable it would seem natural to conclude that software licensing is more profitable than providing software services, which do not scale as cleanly.\autocite[3]{buxmann2012software}
It is relatively easy for new entrants to break into the market, though given it's competitive nature they often struggle to maintain their edge and are often acquired by larger rivals if they do not grow quickly enough.\autocite[]{ValuelineOverview}

The software industry remains dominated by the United Sates which not only accounts for a dominant share of the global market, but also for much of its growth as well.\autocite[]{ITSoftwareEconomist}
The software market is also highly international in nature and software products are often developed by distributed teams.\autocite[3]{buxmann2012software}
The internet will reach 50\% of the worlds population in 2015.\autocite[]{ITSoftwareEconomist}

Their is a field of economics called transaction theory that deals with the costs involved in transactions between different organizations. Since the software business is ultimately defined by the division of labor between software providers and consumers their should theoretically exist substantial benefits to organizational structures that minimize transaction costs.\autocite[42]{buxmann2012software}

Transactions can be classified along a spectron according to how specific they are to particular investments. Markets are the most efficient tool to optimize transaction costs in situations where the specificity of the transactions is low. On the other hand more specific investments where the transaction partners are more interdependent encourage more opportunistic behavior as the parties have greater incentive to try to exploit each other.\autocite[44]{buxmann2012software}
\wrapfig{decisionMatrix}{r}{.5}{Decision matrix of IT outsourcing\autocite[45]{buxmann2012software}}{fig:DecisionMatrix}
The shift towards the internet and IP-based services has had the effect of lowering transaction costs, therefore encouraging standardization of software from dedicated providers rather than homegrown solutions.\autocite[46]{buxmann2012software}

The software industry can be divided into two broad segments, business derived from the sale of software licenses, and the business of selling software and services by contract.\autocite[]{ValuelineOverview}
Consulting fees are usually proportional to the number of working days hired or results while maintenance service fees are usually a flat fraction of the original licensing fee.\autocite[16]{buxmann2012software}
\wrapfig{marketShareOfTypesOfSoftware}{r}{.5}{Market share of software types\autocite[7]{buxmann2012software}}{fig:marketShareofTypesOfSoftware}
The industry began to make a shift to standardized software early on as producers tried to take advantage of their negligible variable costs.\autocite[14]{buxmann2012software}
Oracle is a well known provider of system software, and SAP is popular for application software. The business model of these standards software providers is usually to sell licenses which charge the customer proportional to some metric of usage\autocite[14]{buxmann2012software}

There are two forces that tend to drive spending in the enterprise software industry, there are IT-driven initiatives and there are business driven initiatives.\autocite[]{NextGenBusinessSoftware}
Business driven IT developments tend to be outward facing and focus upon concrete business problems rather than underlying technologies, and in it is this sort of spending that drives much of current IT investment.\autocite[]{NextGenBusinessSoftware}
Mainframes remain strategically important for companies like IBM while Windows remains the keystone of Microsoft's software business. Unix and Windows systems have maintained only limited growth in the mainframe market while Linux has seen more robust growth.\autocite[40]{SurveysSoftware2015}
The projected compound anual growth rate of cloud software from 2013 to 2018 currently rests at 20\% indicating a substantial shift within the industry. Significant players such as Adobe, Autodesk, Oracle, and Microsoft have realigned themselves to try take advantage of the ongoing shift towards cloud based services.\autocite[40]{SurveysSoftware2015}
Databases are divided into two broad catagories, relational and non relational databases, relational databases are more abstract and store data in two dimensional tables. Non relational databaes require users to specify how to retrieve their data, which saves computer resources but is more complicated.\autocite[45]{SurveysSoftware2015}
Enterprise resource management is another important sector of the software industry including business focused upon managing accounting, payroll, and human capital.\autocite[46]{SurveysSoftware2015}
The internet has grown dramatically over the past years, which has helped enable many of the most important transitions within the industry including the shift towards cloud based services and the proliferation of open-source software.\autocite[]{SurveysSoftware2015}
