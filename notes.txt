<General>One of the most important characteristics of software is it's reproducibility.\autocite[3]{buxmann2012software}
<General>Since variable costs involved in software redistribution are effectively negligable it would seem natural to conclude that software licensing is more profitable than providing software services, which do not scale as cleanly.\autocite[3]{buxmann2012software}
<General>The software market is also highly international in nature and software products are often developed by distributed teams.\autocite[3]{buxmann2012software}
<EarlyHistorys>Early software was usually bundled with hardware as a single integrated product.\autocite[4]{buxmann2012software}
<MarketBehavior>Software markets tend to eventually create monopolies, that is to say that the first firm to gain a sufficiently large competitive advantage will usually eventually eradicate it's competition.\autocite[4]{buxmann2012software}
<EarlyHistory,Microsoft>Microsoft is a good example of a company that quickly rose to monopolistic heights with ms-dos, coming to almost completely dominate the desktop market.\autocite[4]{buxmann2012software}
<MarketCharacteristics,MarketShare>\autocite[]{buxmann2012software}
<TypesOfSoftware>\wrapfig{marketShareOfTypesOfSoftware}{r}{.5}{Market share of software types\autocite[7]{buxmann2012software}}
<ServiceProviders>The computer service and support industry is heavily dependent upon the relationship of trust between the service provider and the consumer, who usually have to base their decision of of references.\autocite[9]{buxmann2012software}
<BusinessModels,EarlyHistory>The industry began to make a shift to standardized software early on as producers tried to take advantage of their negligible variable costs.\autocite[14]{buxmann2012software}
<EarlyHistory,BusinessModels,Oracle,SAP>Oracle is a well known provider of system software, and SAP is popular for application software. The business model of these standards software providers is usually to sell licenses which charge the customer proportional to some metric of usage\autocite[14]{buxmann2012software}
<BusinessModels>\wrapfig{genericBusinessModels}{r}{.5}{Generic Business Models\autocite[15]{buxmann2012software}}
<ServiceProviders>Consulting fees are usually proportional to the number of working days hired or results while maintenance service fees are usually a flat fraction of the original licensing fee.\autocite[16]{buxmann2012software}
<Piracy>Most studies aiming to quantify the impact of piracy on the software industry, such as those funded by the business software alliance, assume that every copy of pirated software results directly in a proportional loss the producer. This claim is suspect and it often tends to create wildly exaggerated statistics.\autocite[20]{buxmann2012software}
<NetworkEffects,MarketBehavior>Network effects play a large roll in creating the ``winner takes it all'' environment, the more costumers a given software provider has the harder it is to dislodge their market position.\autocite[21]{buxmann2012software}
<ERP,NetworkEffects>Inter-enterprise network effects influence the market for ERP systems, for example standard formats simplify the exchange of documents between different formats.\autocite[21]{buxmann2012software}
<NetworkEffects>\autocite[]{buxmann2012software}
<NetworkEffects>Indirect network effects are when a given software product leads to a body of associated complimentary software that depends upon it, this essentially increases the cost of competing with it as the complimentary software must be replaced along with the primary platform itself.\autocite[21]{buxmann2012software}

<NetworkEffects,BrowserWars,OpenSource>In 1995 Netscape Navigator had more than 80\% market share. However, when Microsoft decided to enter the market it was able to leverage its deep pockets and control of the windows platform to invest in and distribute the Internet Explorer browser. By 1998 Netscape's market share had collapsed falling to bellow 4\% and the navigator browser was open-sourced, creating the Mozilla project. Without competition the Internet Explorer project stagnated while Mozilla continued to develop after being embraced by the open-source community and eventually reemerged as firefox in 2004 with far more features than Internet Explorer and was able to claim significant market share.\autocite[27]{buxmann2012software}
<NetworkEffects,ValueChain,Platform,MarketBehavior>\wrapfig{valueChain}{r}{.5}{Value chain in the game console industry\autocite[29]{buxmann2012software}}
<NetworkEffects,ValueChain,MarketBehavior>Game consoles are platforms, and are in this sense analogous to operating systems upon which applications are built. These platform providers do not generally have the resources breadth or flexibility to provide a large ecosystem of software on their own, and instead choose to open up the platform to third party software.\autocite[30]{buxmann2012software}
<TransactionTheory,MarketBehavior>Their is a field of economics called transaction theory that deals with the costs involved in transactions between different organizations. Since the software business is ultimately defined by the division of labor between software providers and consumers their should theoretically exist substantial benefits to organizational structures that minimize transaction costs.\autocite[42]{buxmann2012software}
<TransactionTheory,MarketBehavior>\wrapfig{transactionTheory}{r}{.5}{Basic model of transaction cost theory\autocite[43]{buxmann2012software}}
<TransactionTheory>Transactions can be classified along a spectron according to how specific they are to particular investments. Markets are the most efficient tool to optimize transaction costs in situations where the specificity of the transactions is low. On the other hand more specific investments where the transaction partners are more interdependent encourage more opportunistic behavior as the parties have greater incentive to try to exploit each other.\autocite[44]{buxmann2012software}
<TransactionTheory,MarketBehavior>\wrapfig{decisionMatrix}{r}{.5}{Decision matrix of IT outsourcing\autocite[45]{buxmann2012software}}
<TransactionTheory,MarketBehavior>The shift towards the internet and IP-based services has had the effect of lowering transaction costs, therefore encouraging standardization of software from dedicated providers rather than homegrown solutions.\autocite[46]{buxmann2012software}
<Pricing>\fig{parametersOfPricing}{h}{.8}{Parameters of pricing models\autocite[83]{buxmann2012software}}
<OpenSource>Open source projects operate very differently from the traditional for profit centrally directed organizational model of commercial software. Open Source projects are sustained by an international pool of volunteer developers who pool their efforts to produce software.\autocite[191]{buxmann2012software}
<OpenSource>Many open source projects are controlled by their founder who usually functions as the maintainer and retains the authority to decide whether or not to add other developer's work to the mainline project. Linus for example has the final say in whether or not to incorporate changes other's make to the Linux kernel. If the community grows dissatisfied with the maintainer the project can be forked and development continues under a new banner. Since the individual developers are volunteers who decide how to spend their own time small projects start and stop frequently as their developers move on to other things.\autocite[197]{buxmann2012software}
<OpenSource>The opportunity costs in terms of time and effort inherent to contributing effort towards Open Source are obvious, which raises the question of why anyone would do it. Most contributers fall into one of two broad catagories, rent-seekers who work in the hopes of raising their profile, gaining experience, and adding lines to the resume, and donators who work to contribute to the strength of the Open Source ecosystem.\autocite[198]{buxmann2012software}
<OpenSource>Open Source projects are often published under copyleft licenses such as GPL which require the source code to always be made available and for any derivatives works to be published under similar terms. This creates an inducement for donators to contribute code since they can be confident that their work will remain open source, and it forces organizations that make use of the work to push their contributions and changes back to the community.\autocite[198]{buxmann2012software}

<MarketCharteristicts,MarketBehavior>Software is considred to be one of the most competitive sectors in the S\&P. Although legacy companies dominate corporate and consumer software the constant evolution of the technology landscape allows newcomers to be viable competitors.\autocite[38]{SurveysSoftware2015}
<MarketCharteristicts,MarketBehavior>Of the 43 companies listed in the S\&P 500 software industry not a single one was founded after 2000.\autocite[38]{SurveysSoftware2015}
<MarketCharteristicts,MarketBehavior>The four companies with the largest software business Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, and SAP together only acounted for 39\% of the revenues in the industry.\autocite[38]{SurveysSoftware2015}
<MarketCharteristicts,MarketBehavior>There are many new entrants in the software industry, and it is comparatively easy for software start ups gain large quantities funding and high early valuations. However building up revenue and establishing stable relations with clients and sustainable profits takes much more time.\autocite[39]{SurveysSoftware2015}
<MarketCharteristicts,MarketBehavior,Cloud>The industry currently engaged in a transition to cloud based services.\autocite[39]{SurveysSoftware2015}
<MarketCharteristicts,MarketBehavior>Since the software industry is not dependant upon any material resources it is not beholden to its suppliers. However the S\&PCapital IQ suggest that software companies instead compete over another type of limited resource, skilled developers; and that smaller companies are at a disadvantage with regards to acquiring and retaining capable employees.\autocite[39]{SurveysSoftware2015}
<MarketCharteristicts,MarketBehavior,OpenSource>Mainframes remain strategically important for companies like IBM while Windows remains the keystone of Microsoft's software business. Unix and Windows systems have maintained only limited growth in the mainframe market while Linux has seen more robust growth.\autocite[40]{SurveysSoftware2015}
<MarketCharteristicts,MarketBehavior,Cloud>The projected compound anual growth rate of cloud software from 2013 to 2018 currently rests at 20\% indicating a substantial shift within the industry. Significant players such as Adobe, Autodesk, Oracle, and Microsoft have realigned themselves to try take advantage of the ongoing shift towards cloud based services.\autocite[40]{SurveysSoftware2015}
<MarketCharacteristics,Databases>Databases are divided into two broad catagories, relational and non relational databases, relational databases are more abstract and store data in two dimensional tables. Non relational databaes require users to specify how to retrieve their data, which saves computer resources but is more complicated.\autocite[45]{SurveysSoftware2015}
<MarketCharacteristics,ERP>Enterprise resource management is another important sector of the software industry including business focused upon managing accounting, payroll, and human capital.\autocite[46]{SurveysSoftware2015}
<Internet,Network,Cloud>The internet has grown dramatically over the past years, which has helped enable many of the most important transitions within the industry including the shift towards cloud based services and the proliferation of open-source software.\autocite[]{SurveysSoftware2015}
<OpenSource>Work by individual contributors to the Linux kernel is at an all time low with only 5.8\% of the changes coming from unpaid volunteers.\autocite[]{KernelDevelopment2015}
<MarketCharacteristics>\autocite[]{SurveysSoftware2015}
<History,MarketCharacteristics>From 1997 to 2000 there was a buying frenzy in the business software industry as the Y2K panic drove greater investment in enterprise software.\autocite[]{AftermathOfIntegratedStack}
<History,MarketCharacteristics>This enthusiasitic purchasing diminshed somewhat as business struggled to integrate and make effective use of their investments.\autocite[]{AftermathOfIntegratedStack}
<History,MarketCharacteristics>Enterprise software has had a substantial impact upon business over the past few years as these integration efforts have begun to pay off. Retail for example has seen historically low inventories and fewer seasonal hires, arguably as a result efficiencies gained through the effective use of enterprise resource management software. \autocite[]{AftermathOfIntegratedStack}
<IntegratedStacks>Companies have now shifted towards what are called integrated stacks, software packages that combine as many of the essentially components of the computer system's architecture as possible. Combining diverse tools into a single product that unifies hardware, middleware, virtualization layer, operating system, and enterprise applications.\autocite[]{AftermathOfIntegratedStack}
<Cloud>Cloud computing is really just a model of renting storage and processing time to clients.\autocite[]{AftermathOfIntegratedStack}
<Cloud>The real advantage of cloud computing is that the host can take advantage of far greater economies of scale than their individual clients could on their own, pushing down costs dramatically.\autocite[]{AftermathOfIntegratedStack}
<IntegratedStacks>Integrated stacks can lower the cost of deploying new enterprise software solutions, whereas in the past most of the expense involved in deploying new software was actually in having internal IT departments integrate all of the diverse tools and platforms integrated stacks can be purchased deployed and maintained quickly and cheaply.\autocite[]{AftermathOfIntegratedStack}
<Cloud>Cloud service providers also integrate their own tools into their offerings to help their costumers use and manage their cloud resources.\autocite[]{AftermathOfIntegratedStack}
<MarketBehavior>There is a growing shift towards more ``transparent'' IT solutions which try to hide from the end user with more embedded and cloud based applications.\autocite[]{OptimismInnovation}
<Cloud>Microsoft's emphasis on their Azure cloud platform represents a major shift for the company as it tries to push its way into a into an already competitive and crowded field.\autocite[]{OptimismInnovation}
<OpenSource>Red Hat is another interesting player given that they have long been at the center of the open source movement and have managed to act like a sort of curator for open source technology.\autocite[]{OptimismInnovation}
<OpenSource>There were almost one billion lines of source code released publicly and freely available online in 2010.\autocite[]{OptimismInnovation}
<OpenSource>Red Hat has built there entire business around software that can be freely copied by their competitors, and as a result has minimal switching costs. Yet Red Hat's revenues continue to grow considerably faster than overall IT spending.\autocite[]{OptimismInnovation}
<OpenSource>Some industry analysts believe that the open source development process ultimately leads to better code than proprietary alternatives.\autocite[]{OptimismInnovation}
<MarketCharacteristics,SaaS>Software as a service is growing component of the software industry and holds several key advantages over more traditional sales models, most importantly in terms of cost and ease of deployment.\autocite[]{GrowthTrendsSoftwareService}
<MarketCharacteristics,SaaS>The industry has made a significant transition towards the software as a service.\autocite[]{TransitionPhaseEnterpriseApplication}
<MarketCharacteristics,SaaS>Analysts argues that although investor interest in the software as a service sector has declined recently their still exist plenty of opportunities for growth and consolidation.\autocite[]{GrowthTrendsSoftwareService}
<EarlyHistory>Historically computing was dominated by mainframes like those sold and supported by IBM; in this model all the actual computing is carried out in central processors and the access points to control the computers were dumb terminals.\autocite[]{LargeParadigmShiftCloudComputing}
<EarlyHistory>The personal computer broke this model and pushed most of the industry towards the client/server architecture where much of the processing takes place directly on the users terminal.\autocite[]{LargeParadigmShiftCloudComputing}
<History,Cloud>In many regards cloud computing is a return to more of a dumb terminal paradigm where most of the actual processing takes place in remote data centers rather than on the user's workstation.\autocite[]{LargeParadigmShiftCloudComputing}
<Cloud,Virtualiztion>Virtualization is another important technology that has begun to play a significant role over the past few tears.\autocite[]{LargeParadigmShiftCloudComputing}
<Virtualiztion,Cloud>Virtualization allows multiple operating systems and software stacks to be hosted upon a server by introducing a layer of abstraction between the operating systems and the raw hardware of the host machine.\autocite[]{LargeParadigmShiftCloudComputing}
<MarketBehavior>The nature of the Software industry is to tend towards greater consolidation.\autocite[]{LargeParadigmShiftCloudComputing}
Small companies are often able to get off to a strong start due to venture capital but they are often bought up by their larger rivals once they have grown to the point where they can begin to make themselves a nuisance. \autocite[]{LargeParadigmShiftCloudComputing}
<IOT>The internet of things is development in the software industry that has captured the attention of analysts.\autocite[]{LargeParadigmShiftCloudComputing}
<IOT>The core idea of the internet of things is that as computers grow ever more inexpensive and networking ever easier and abundant it will be possible to connect almost every conceivable device to the internet in order to harvest data and automate as many processes as possible.\autocite[]{LargeParadigmShiftCloudComputing}
<Cloud,SaaS>Salesforce.com is an important player in the cloud computing business as it has managed to grow into the largest cloud software company in the world following a successful software as a service model.\autocite[]{CloudAnalyticsCybersecurityApplication}
<MarketCharacetristics>Overall IT spending has been growing at an annual rate of about 2-3\%, while cloud-based software, big data analytics, and cybersecurity are expected to remain growth areas.\autocite[]{CloudAnalyticsCybersecurityApplication}
<Payments>Digital payment technologies are another interesting area of recent innovation with companies like square processing bringing credit card processing capacities to small businesses that could not otherwise afford them.\autocite[]{CloudAnalyticsCybersecurityApplication}
<Payments>More established companies have also begun to tack towards mobile payments, such Alphabet with Google Wallet and Apple  with Apple Pay.\autocite[]{CloudAnalyticsCybersecurityApplication}
<OpenSource,Cloud>Microsoft and Red Hat have reached an agreement to bring Red Hat's enterprise Linux operating system to the Microsoft Azure cloud.\autocite[]{MSRHTDeal}
